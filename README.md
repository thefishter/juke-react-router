Spotify clone, part 2: learning front end routing using react-router


Grace Hopper Academy Workshop, Week 5

The series of Juke workshops are designed to increase familiarity with the React
ecosystem by creating a Spotify clone as a single-page application. Such 
applications do not refresh and instead dynamically replace their content to 
simulate changing pages.

For this workshop, we'll be focusing on front-end "routes," refactoring our 
existing app with React Router. This will provide an elegant and powerful 
abstraction for the view swapping we are currently doing with conditional logic 
in our JSX. Once we are finished, we will have tabs for two different views - 
ALBUMS and SONGS - so a user will see each one at a time, with the URL changing 
as we change state.
